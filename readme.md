## ShapeVisualization3D

Creation and overlay visualization of various 3D shape types.

### How to Run

Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or
debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
Results can be seen in the 3D viewer on the DevicePage.Zoom in on the
visualized shapes for best experience.
Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show images after loading the webpage.
To run this Sample a device with SICK Algorithm API and AppEngine >= V2.5.0 is
required. For example SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the Emulator
in AppStudio 2.3 or higher can be used.
